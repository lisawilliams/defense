# Defense Against the (Dark) Digital Arts

Slides for a presentation to colleagues on countering online harassment and abuse.
Presentation available online [here](https://lisawilliams.github.io/defense/).

### Reveal.js Presentation Template

I build my presentations with Reveal.js, a Javascript framework for building web-ready presentations in HTML. [Check out the live demo of Reveal.js](http://revealjs.com/). I then host them on Github Pages, making them available to users without having to ship Powerpoint files around.

More details on how I did it: [Building Web-Ready Slideshows With Reveal.js](https://lisawilliams.github.io/lisa/tech/2018/03/04/reveal-js-slideshows.html).

I relied on Chen Hui Jing's [excellent tutorial on doing slide decks in Reveal.js](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/revealjs-and-github-pages/#%F0%9F%91%9F) to get started.
